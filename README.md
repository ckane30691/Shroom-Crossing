This is a take on the classic arcade game Frogger released by Konami in 1981. The objective of the game is to maneuver the mushroom across the playfield to the river as many times as possible without hitting any enemies.

## Background & Overview
Oh no the natives are after you for your psychedelic properties and the government has sent robots in to regulate!

Your only hope is to score spore points by crossing the board to the river as many times as possible!

Watch out for enemies, the longer you play the faster they get!
