This is a take on the classic arcade game Frogger released by Konami in 1981. The objective of the game is to cross the playfield to the river as many times as possible without hitting any enemies.

## Background & Overview
The player controls a mushroom that can move around the board.

Watch out for enemies, the longer you play the faster they get.
